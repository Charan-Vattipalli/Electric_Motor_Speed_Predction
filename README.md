# Electric_Motor_Speed_Predction
This project predicts motor speed (RPM) based on voltage, temperature, load, and other sensor data using a Decision Tree model. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, scaling, and model training. The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to manually input values and get real-time predictions. 🚀


🚀 Features
✅ User Input Fields: Manually enter voltage, temperature, and load
✅ Machine Learning Model: Trained Decision Tree model for speed prediction
✅ Real-time Prediction: Get instant motor speed predictions based on input values
✅ Interactive Web UI: Simple interface built with Streamlit
